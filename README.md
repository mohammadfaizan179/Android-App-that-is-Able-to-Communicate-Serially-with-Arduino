# Android-App-that-is-Able-to-Communicate-Serially-with-Arduino
The Android app will be developed that will communicate with Arduino serially.

We have to develop an android app that have a feature to communicate with Arduino and can display the water quality sensors' data, so that the quality of water can be analyzed.

Therefore we started from the very basic. Initially we learn and developed and android app of simple calculator that can perform arithmetic operation like addition. The user can give the inputs i.e. from the mobile app. This input data from the app is send to the Arduino where the logic is implemented and compute the result that is displayed on the app. The results are attached in the file section. 

Then we move step ahead. We learn to control a hardware serially via the App. We developed an android App from which we can control an LED status. The two buttons i.e. ON & OFF are provided in App to change the status of LED. The command is given via the App that is sent to microcontroller where the logical operation is executed to turn ON and OFF the LED. The results are attached.

Then we took one of the sensor of our project i.e. Total Dissolved Solid (TDS) Sensor. The sensor is interfaced with the Arduino UNO. The TDS value of water is measured and analyzed. Then we Developed an Android App with user friendly interface that is able to communicate serially with Arduino. The TDS value of water is sent to the APP where the results are display to the users.
